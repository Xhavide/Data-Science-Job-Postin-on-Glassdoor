 # 🧹 1. Data Cleaning in SQL – Job Market Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a real-world dataset of data science job postings to ensure data quality, consistency, and usability for analysis.

Using SQL Server, raw data was processed into a structured, analysis-ready format by handling inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.

-----------

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains job market data, including:

- Job Title
- Company Name
- Location
- Salary Estimate
- Rating
- Industry, Sector, Revenue
- Competitors

  ---------------

  
## ⚙️ Data Cleaning Process

The dataset required multiple transformation steps:

- Removed duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER()
- Cleaned and standardized the Salary Estimate column
- Extracted Salary Min, Max, and Average values
- Split Location into City and State
- Removed company rating values from Company Name
- Replaced placeholder values (e.g., -1) with NULL
- Standardized numerical fields (e.g., Rating)
- Dropped redundant and intermediate columns

--------

## 💻 Example SQL Step – Removing Duplicate Rows

```
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
               PARTITION BY [Job Title], Location, [Company Name]
               ORDER BY [Job Title]
           ) AS rn
    FROM dbo.[Data Science Job Postin on Glassdoor]
)
DELETE FROM CTE
WHERE rn > 1;
```



## Example SQL Step – Extract and clean salary range
```
UPDATE dbo.ds_jobs_cleaned
SET [Salary Estimate] = SUBSTRING([Salary Estimate], 1, CHARINDEX('(', [Salary Estimate]) - 1)
WHERE [Salary Estimate] LIKE '%(%';

UPDATE dbo.ds_jobs_cleaned
SET Salary_Min = TRY_CAST(PARSENAME(REPLACE([Salary Estimate], '-', '.'), 2) AS INT),
    Salary_Max = TRY_CAST(PARSENAME(REPLACE([Salary Estimate], '-', '.'), 1) AS INT);
```

----------
## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Real-world datasets often contain inconsistent formats and placeholder values
- Cleaning salary data requires string manipulation and type conversion
- Proper handling of missing values improves data reliability
- Structuring location and company data enhances usability for analysis

------------

## 🛠 Tools Used

- SQL Server
- SQL (Data Cleaning, Transformations, Window Functions)

  ------------
  
## 📊 Data Quality Summary

- Duplicate records removed
- Missing values standardized
- Salary data transformed into numeric format
- Dataset structured for downstream analysis

------------

## 💼 Business Relevance

Clean and reliable data is essential for accurate insights.
This project demonstrates how raw job market data can be transformed into a structured dataset that supports:

- Salary analysis
- Market trends evaluation
- Industry benchmarking

# 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL – Job Market Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring a cleaned dataset of data science job postings to uncover insights related to salaries, job distribution, company demand, and market trends.

Using SQL, the dataset was analyzed to identify patterns that can support job market understanding and data-driven decision-making.

---------

## 🎯 Business Questions

- Which job roles offer the highest salaries?
- Which locations have the highest demand for data roles?
- How does salary vary across industries?
- Do higher-rated companies offer better salaries?
- What is the distribution of salaries across the market?

------------


## 📊 Key Analysis Areas

- Salary analysis by job title
- Geographic distribution of jobs
- Company hiring trends
- Industry-level salary comparison
- Salary distribution segmentation

-----------

## 💻 Example SQL

```
SELECT 
    [Job Title],
    ROUND(AVG(Salary_Avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM dbo.ds_jobs_cleaned
GROUP BY [Job Title]
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

---------

## 💡 Key Insights

- Senior and specialized roles tend to offer significantly higher salaries
- Certain states dominate job availability, indicating regional demand concentration
- Salary levels vary across industries, reflecting differences in skill demand
- Higher company ratings show moderate correlation with salary levels
- Most job postings fall within the mid-salary range, indicating a competitive market

-----------

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQL Server
- SQL (Aggregations, Grouping, Data Analysis)

--------

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Dataset represents a snapshot and may not reflect long-term trends
- Salary estimates are ranges and may vary from actual compensation

----------

## 💼 Business Relevance

This analysis provides insights into:

- Job market demand
- Salary benchmarking
- Industry hiring trends
- Geographic opportunities
